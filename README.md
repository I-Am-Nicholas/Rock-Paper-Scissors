7. In your browser, type 'localhost: ' followed by whatever port number the server has specified.

8. Play!


## For a more advanced iteration I would...

  * Implement a best-of-three game as per the accepted game rules, perhaps using an array to store scores temporarily within the Game class.

  * Add some graphic interaction.
