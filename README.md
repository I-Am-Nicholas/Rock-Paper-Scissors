## To Play

1. Please navigate to your chosen directory from the command line and insert the following:

- git clone https://github.com/marudine/Rock-Paper-Scissors

This will download the necessary files to your machine.

2. type 'cd rps-challenge'

3. Type 'bundle install' to download the external libraries (gems) you will need to run this application.

4. Type 'rspec --init' to set up your test components.

5. Type 'rspec' in order to run the unit and feature tests.

6. Type 'rackup' in order to start the server. The output will tell you which port to use for the next step.

7. In your browser, type 'localhost: ' followed by whatever port number the server has specified.

8. Play!


## For a more advanced iteration I would...

  * Implement a best-of-three game as per the accepted game rules, perhaps using an array to store scores temporarily within the Game class.

  * Add some graphic interaction.
